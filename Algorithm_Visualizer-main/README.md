# Algorithm_Visualizer

This Algorithm Visualizer project is a web-based tool that allows users to interactively visualize various algorithms, providing a visual representation of how these algorithms work.

Features
Algorithm Visualization: View step-by-step visualizations of popular algorithms such as sorting (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort), pathfinding (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm), and more.
Interactive Controls: Users can adjust parameters, input data, and control the visualization speed to better understand algorithm behavior.
Responsive Design: The web application is designed to be responsive and accessible across different devices.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure and layout of the web pages.
CSS: Styling and design for an intuitive user interface.
JavaScript: Core logic and interactivity for algorithm visualization.
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open index.html in a web browser.
Select an algorithm from the provided options.
Input parameters or data as required.
Run the visualization and observe the algorithm in action.
